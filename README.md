**SnoopJake Email** is an email app made with React.ts + Vite and Django.

We developed it for the sake of training ourselves, and further develop the skills required to work as a team on the modern software development workflows.
_(Like CI/CD, QA workflows, AWS and project management with JIRA)_

This repository contains both the `frontend` content of our email client and the `backend` of our application, as a **Monorepo** application.

Each of these `front` and `back` repos contain their respectives `README` files that further explain the details of their respective domain.

Cheers!
