# How to navigate the documentation

## Simple!

Its as easy as it could get, just search for the component that you want on the left side (we don't have a search bar yet, sorry!).

The docs are written in markdown, so be sure to take advantage of this by using the headers!

Also, each Component is composed of multiple cards divided by a self describing topic. Be sure to access them as you see fit!
